## Exploring Education Outcomes in Massachusetts

### Team Members

Alex Craig & Aaron Xie

### Project Summary
Our project hopes to explore the relationship between a multitude of factors with testing outcomes
in the Massachussets school system. Some factors we wish to compare include expenditure per
student, racial makeup, school district income level, school
size, and more. We wish to identify the primary trends / indicators that point towards high performing schools and low performing schools, as well as clustering schools into various profiles. To accomplish this, we will analyze the publicly available [data](https://www.doe.mass.edu/SchDistrictData.html), provided by the Massachusett's Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.
